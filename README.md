## X-Safe: Cross-Chain Gnosis Safe Multi-Sig Optimization

### [XSafe | ETHGlobal New York 2023](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/xsafe-bbj01)

### Overview
X-Safe aims to optimize the Gnosis Safe multi-sig framework for multi-chain transactions. It simplifies identical administrative functions on multiple blockchains by enabling single signature propagation and transaction broadcasting.

### Technical Features
- **Gnosis Safe Integration**: Inherits security measures and features from Gnosis Safe, adding multi-chain capabilities.
- **Single Signature Propagation**: Eliminates need for individual signing on each chain.
- **Single Transaction Broadcast**: Executes identical smart contract methods or admin functions on multiple chains.
- **Chain Agnostic**: Compatible with any blockchain supported by Gnosis Safe.

### Workflow
1. **Initialization**: One-time custom module setup via Gnosis Safe UI.
2. **Transaction Creation**: Multi-chain transaction initiated.
3. **Signature Generation**: Transaction signed via X-Safe interface.
4. **Signature Propagation**: Signatures sent to corresponding Gnosis Safe contracts.
5. **Transaction Execution**: Triggered on all chains based on user settings.

### Use Cases
- Smart contract deployment on multiple chains.
- DAO governance parameter updates across multiple chains.
- Cross-chain asset management.

### Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Reduces time for multi-chain ops.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Cuts down transaction costs.
- **Security**: Leverages Gnosis Safe security features, adds cross-chain functionality.

By adopting X-Safe, developers can make their cross-chain operations more efficient, secure, and cost-effective.
